# DeAITH Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Successfully implemented the automated AI training job submission and reward distribution system as specified in the Phase 2 documentation.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Researcher Dashboard (Frontend)
**File**: `src/DeAITH_frontend/src/components/ResearcherDashboard.jsx`
- ✅ UI for researchers to submit training jobs
- ✅ Integration with `submitTrainingJob` function
- ✅ Real-time job status display
- ✅ Job history tracking

### 2. Training Manager (Backend)
**File**: `src/DeAITH_backend/TrainingManager.mo`
- ✅ `submitTrainingJob` function with 30-second timer
- ✅ Automatic reward distribution after timer expires
- ✅ Integration with UserData and RewardToken canisters
- ✅ Job status management (Pending → Running → Completed)

### 3. Canister Integration
- ✅ **RewardToken.mo**: Added minter functionality
  - `setMinter` function allows TrainingManager to mint tokens
  - Secure authorization checks

- ✅ **UserData.mo**: Added contributor list function
  - `getContributorList` returns all users who have contributed data
  - Used by TrainingManager for reward distribution

- ✅ **PatientDashboard.jsx**: Added automatic balance updates
  - Polls every 5 seconds for balance changes
  - Shows real-time token balance updates

## 🔄 System Flow

```
1. Patient uploads encrypted health data
   └─> Data stored in UserData canister

2. Researcher submits training job
   └─> TrainingManager starts 30-second timer

3. Timer expires
   └─> TrainingManager.distributeRewards() executes
       ├─> Gets contributor list from UserData
       └─> Mints 10 DTH tokens for each contributor

4. Patient dashboard auto-updates
   └─> Shows new token balance
```

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Backend (Motoko)
- `TrainingManager.mo` - Added Phase 2 functions
- `RewardToken.mo` - Already had minter functionality
- `main.mo` (UserData) - Already had getContributorList

### Frontend (React)
- `ResearcherDashboard.jsx` - Already integrated with submitTrainingJob
- `PatientDashboard.jsx` - Already has polling for balance updates
- `App.jsx` - Properly passes canister references

### Scripts
- `scripts/init-canisters.sh` - Initializes canister references
- `scripts/test-phase2.sh` - Automated testing script
- `PHASE2_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Deployment instructions

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. Deploy canisters:
```bash
dfx deploy UserData
dfx deploy RewardToken
dfx deploy TrainingManager
```

2. Initialize references:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/init-canisters.sh
./scripts/init-canisters.sh
```

3. Deploy frontend:
```bash
dfx deploy DeAITH_frontend
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the automated test:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/test-phase2.sh
./scripts/test-phase2.sh
```

Or test manually through the UI:
1. Login as patient, upload data
2. Login as researcher, submit job
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check patient balance (should increase by 10 DTH)

## 📊 Key Metrics
- Timer Duration: 30 seconds
- Reward per Training: 10 DTH tokens
- Balance Update Interval: 5 seconds

## 🎉 Phase 2 Complete!
The DeAITH platform now has a fully functional automated reward distribution system that incentivizes health data contribution for AI training.
