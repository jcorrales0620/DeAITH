# `DeAITH`

Welcome to your new `DeAITH` project and to the Internet Computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can edit these template files to customize your project and to include your own code to speed up the development cycle.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with `DeAITH`, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd DeAITH/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

## Revenue Model

Our revenue model is centered around the DTH token and the DeAITH platform, creating a sustainable business model that benefits all stakeholders.

### DTH Token Utility
The DTH token is the lifeblood of the DeAITH ecosystem, with a variety of use cases designed to create a vibrant and self-sustaining economy:

- **Data Access**: Researchers must use DTH tokens to pay for access to the datasets they need for their work. This is the primary driver of token demand.
- **Staking for Governance**: Token holders can stake their DTH to participate in decentralized governance, voting on proposals related to platform development, data access policies, and the allocation of ecosystem funds.
- **Reward Distribution**: Patients are rewarded with DTH tokens for contributing their data, creating a direct incentive for participation and data liquidity.
- **Premium Features**: Access to premium features, such as advanced AI-driven analytics, will require payment in DTH tokens.
- **Marketplace**: A future marketplace for health-related services and products will use DTH as the primary currency.

### Revenue Streams
The DeAITH platform will generate revenue through a variety of streams, ensuring its long-term sustainability:

- **Data Access Fees**: A percentage of the fees paid by researchers for data access will be allocated to the platform's treasury.
- **Subscription Services**: Recurring revenue will be generated from subscription plans for researchers and other data consumers, offering tiered access to data and platform features.
- **Transaction Fees**: A small fee will be charged on all transactions within the DeAITH ecosystem, including token transfers and marketplace purchases.
- **AI Model Licensing**: As the platform develops its own AI models, these will be licensed to pharmaceutical companies and other healthcare organizations, creating a valuable new revenue stream.

### Value Creation and Sustainability
The DeAITH revenue model is designed to create a virtuous cycle of value creation and sustainability:

- **Increased Data Contribution**: By rewarding patients for their data, we incentivize the growth of our data pool, making the platform more valuable to researchers.
- **Increased Demand for DTH**: As more researchers use the platform, the demand for DTH tokens will increase, driving up their value.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: A portion of the platform's revenue will be reinvested into the ecosystem, funding further development, research grants, and community initiatives.
- **Token Buy-Back and Burn**: To create deflationary pressure and increase the value of the DTH token, a portion of the platform's profits will be used to buy back and burn tokens from the open market.
